My alfred custom searches, `mdn {query}` `so {query}`

Fun / weird ones `scry {query}`

Alfred text expand snippets, workflow, etc.

Workflows & shit to install. Use the bookmarks tool and save a bunch of helpful start pages in your bookmarks like "[New Repo](https://github.com/new)" which drops you right onto the GitHub page for creating a new repository from the Alfred bar.

Basic Alfred custom searches, `mdn {query}`, `so {query}`, `npm {query}`

When you create these, check for the "apple-touch-icon.png" file at the site's route and use it as your search or workflow icon.

Alfred text-expand snippets, workflow emoji, etc.

Workflows & shit to install. Use the bookmarks tool and save, and then save a bunch of helpful start pages in your bookmarks like "[New Repo](https://github.com/new)" which drops you right onto the GitHub page for creating a new repository from the Alfred bar.

Use modifier keys to change `gh {query}` from "search github" into "search my repositories"

More fun & weird ones: `scry {query}` to do a scryfall syntax search, `mox {query}` to search either all Moxfield decks or just your own.

You should probably reformat and factory reset your laptop either between major OS versions, projects, or yearly. The files on your work machine probably all exist somewhere in the cloud.

> I remarked to Dennis that easily half the code I was writing in Multics was error recovery code. He said, "We left all that stuff out. If there's an error, we have this routine called panic, and when it is called, the machine crashes, and you holler down the hall, 'Hey, reboot it.'"

Setting your dev environment back up is a chore. These are copies of todo lists, config files, and guides I've written to speed up my next reinstall.

- Setting up iTerm and zsh
- vscode extensions & config
- node, homebrew, npm globals

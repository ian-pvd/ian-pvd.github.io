I was hooked on computers by ‘96, and immediately started taking them apart. I'm fascinated by software and what it's able to do. I started programming text-based games, learning 3D animation, making computer graphics, and building my first website. Now I build full-featured applications for the web. I’m still impressed with code, and how it’s able to turn ideas into programs that people can use.

I collect music, and spend a lot of time learning about new artists and labels. I've written album reviews, label showcases, published playlists, and built a ReactJS client for discovering music on Bandcamp.

I spend as much time as I can hiking, camping, and backpacking the Catskills. In New York City, I try to walk around a new neighborhood every month to see what’s there.

I’m currently doing business as PVD Industrial, working as a freelance web developer, and building an e-commence platform for artists, brands and influencers.

I am available for full-time & freelance remote work.

Hey I'm Ian, a full-stack web developer. Originally from Providence, Rhode Island, I've been living in Brooklyn since 2015.

I jumped into web development in 2006 with a pair of books on CSS and PHP & MySQL. Since then I've studied web development & graphic design, and become fluent with CSS, Javascript, and WordPress custom theme & plugin development. Over the past 15 years I have helped deliver web projects for Hilton, GE, the Guggenheim, Brookings, Digital First Media, People & Entertainment Weekly, T-Mobile, Andreessen Horowitz, ADT, SoFi Stadium, and Velcro. I've spent the past 11 years working with fully-distributed WordPress VIP partner agencies, delivering high quality enterprise-scale WorkPress & NextJS projects with short timelines and tight budgets.

Using to code to build visually interesting, performant, accessible, and optimized web applications is a full-time passion of mine. In edition to client work, I enjoy working on self-directed projects to help me learn new skills, contributing to help build simple & useful tooling, project scaffolds, and starter themes.

Outside of work, my time is spent camping & hiking, watching astronomy and nature documentaries, cooking, working out, playing EDH, and wandering around New York.

- How does mac handle context menu shortcuts in new macOS. I think they got rid of automator. (maybe bump the pub date up)
- Check if the SVGO npm package is available on the command line.
  - If it is, run it.
  - If not, use npx
- The command should format & replace whatever SVG markup is selected.
- I believe it was Pattie Reeves who gave me this idea, while I was at Alley

- Google mentions a `disabled` attribue that I'd never heard of before. They say it could be used on link tags to prevent render blocking.
- The MDN docs mention a `disabled` attribue that can be used on link tags but say that it's deprecated.
- However, Can I Use says 97% of browsers support it.
- Should you use it?
- How do you use it?

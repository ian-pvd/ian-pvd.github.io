Over the past 15 years I have helped deliver web projects for Hilton, GE, the Guggenheim, Brookings, Digital First Media, People & Entertainment Weekly, T-Mobile, Andreessen Horowitz, ADT, SoFi Stadium, and Velcro.

## My Projects

I have a collection of some of my personal code projects available to browse on GitHub.

[![Deep Forest project title card.](http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/deep-forest.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Deep Forest](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"} is a Jekyll starter theme for creatives who want to build clean & simple resume or portfolio sites hosted on github pages. It's the basis for this ian-pvd site.

[![Gothamish theme homepage.](http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/gothamish.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Gothamish](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"} is a WordPress theme for New York. This project was in response to Gothamist shutting down after it was sold in 2017. The theme was built so that anyone can make a WordPress site that resembles Gothamist's appearance at the time. It also modernized some features for accessibility, performance, and other quality of life improvements.

[![Color Extract app screenshot.](http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/color-extract.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Color Extract](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"} is a simple react app for finding colors inside clipboard text. It looks for color codes, dedupes them, suggests color names, and makes a list of SCSS variables or CSS custom properties that you can copy into your project. A big help when you're starting a build with new colors.

## More Repos
Check out the rest of [my github repositories](https://github.com/ian-pvd?tab=repositories){:target="_blank"} for more code samples.

A few of my WIP projects include the [Roundhouse](https://github.com/ian-pvd/roundhouse-2021){:target="blank"} WordPress theme scaffold for media libraries, and a [filmsâ€¢fm](https://github.com/ian-pvd/films-fm){:target="_blank"} movie rating app built with NextJS.

I've also made contributions to some open source projects, [node packages](https://github.com/bencevans/color-array-average), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/){:target="_blank"}, and previously on Alley's [Huron](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/huron){:target="_blank"} styleguide generator.

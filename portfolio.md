Over the past 15 years I've delivered websites and single page applications for [the Guggenheim](https://alley.com/news/a-look-under-the-hood-with-the-new-guggenheim-org/){:target="_blank"}, GE, [People & Entertainment Weekly](https://alley.com/news/alley-launches-people-com-one-of-the-biggest-sites-on-wordpress-com-vip/){:target="_blank"}, Digital First Media, [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/pixels-and-progress-the-evolution-of-brookings-edu-since-1995/){:target="_blank"}, T-Mobile, [ADT](https://newsroom.adt.com/){:target="_blank"}, Velcro, [the state of California](https://calrx.ca.gov/){:target="_blank"}, 70 Faces Media, [HKS](https://www.hksinc.com/){:target="_blank"}, A16Z, [Hilton](https://stories.hilton.com/){:target="_blank"}, and other marketing, big media, and enterprise teams.

## My Projects

My GitHub has a collection of personal projects I've set up to help organize things I'm interested in, show off a proof of concept, or utilities to help simplify development on other projects. Here's a collection of some of my personal projects that are available on GitHub.

[![Deep Forest project title card.](/assets/images/deep-forest.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

ðŸŒ³ The Jekyll starter theme [Deep Forest](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"} is for creators who want to build clean & simple resume or portfolio sites hosted on github pages. It's the basis for this portfolio site.

[![Gothamish theme homepage.](/assets/images/gothamish.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

ðŸ—½ The city culture blog Gothamist was shut down after it was sold in 2017. This motivated me to build [Gothamish](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"}, a WordPress theme about New York. The theme is configured as a framework that would allow anyone to create their own local blog that resembled Gothamist's appearance at the time. It also modernized some features for accessibility, performance, and made user experience improvements.

[![Color Extract app screenshots.](/assets/images/color-extract.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

ðŸŽ¨ The simple React web app [Color Extract](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"} checks for colors in clipboard text. It finds color codes, de-dupes them, suggests color names, and creates a list of CSS variables to copy into your project. A time-saver when migrating CSS from old stylesheets or implementing new brand guidelines.

## My Repos
Check out the rest of [my github repositories](https://github.com/ian-pvd?tab=repositories){:target="_blank"} for more code samples.

A few of my WIP projects include the [Roundhouse](https://github.com/ian-pvd/roundhouse-2021){:target="blank"} WordPress theme scaffold for creators & multimedia libraries, and a [filmsâ€¢fm](https://github.com/ian-pvd/films-fm){:target="_blank"} movie tracking and rating app built with NextJS.

I've also made contributions to some open source projects, [node packages](https://github.com/bencevans/color-array-average), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/){:target="_blank"}, and previously on Alley's [Huron](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/huron){:target="_blank"} styleguide generator.

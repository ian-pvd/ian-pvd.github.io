## My Projects

[![Deep Forest project title card.](http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/deep-forest.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Deep Forest](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"} is a Jekyll starter theme for creatives who want to build clean & simple resume or portfolio sites hosted on github pages. It's the basis for this ian-pvd site.

[![Gothamish theme homepage.](http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/gothamish.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Gothamish](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"} is a WordPress theme for New York. This project was inspired by the shutdown of Gothamist after it was sold in 2017. The theme was built to make a WordPress site resemble Gothamist's appearance at the time. It also modernized some features for accessibility, performance, and other quality of life improvements.

[![Color Extract app screenshot.](http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/color-extract.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Color Extract](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"} is a simple react applet for finding colors inside clipboard text. It looks for color codes, dedupes them, suggests color names, and builds a list of SCSS variables or CSS custom properties that you can copy into your project. A big help when you're starting with new brand colors.

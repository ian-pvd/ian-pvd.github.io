Over the past 15 years I've helped deliver client projects for [the Guggenheim](https://alley.com/news/a-look-under-the-hood-with-the-new-guggenheim-org/){:target="_blank"}, GE, [Hilton](https://stories.hilton.com/){:target="_blank"}, Digital First Media, [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/){:target="_blank"}, People & Entertainment Weekly, [the state of California](https://calrx.ca.gov/){:target="_blank"}, T-Mobile, [HKS](https://www.hksinc.com/){:target="_blank"} Andreessen Horowitz, [ADT](https://newsroom.adt.com/){:target="_blank"}, Velcro, and other enterprise clients.

## My Projects

My GitHub has a collection of personal projects I've set up to help organize things I'm interested in, show off a proof of concept, or utilities to help simplify development on other projects. Here's a collection of some of my personal projects that are available on GitHub.

[![Deep Forest project title card.](/assets/images/deep-forest.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Deep Forest](https://github.com/ian-pvd/deep-forest){:target="_blank"} is a Jekyll starter theme for creatives who want to build clean & simple resume or portfolio sites hosted on github pages. It's the basis for this ian-pvd site.

[![Gothamish theme homepage.](/assets/images/gothamish.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Gothamish](https://github.com/ian-pvd/gothamish){:target="_blank"} is a WordPress theme for New York. This project was in response to Gothamist shutting down after it was sold in 2017. The theme was built so that anyone can make a WordPress site that resembles Gothamist's appearance at the time. It also modernized some features for accessibility, performance, and other quality of life improvements.

[![Color Extract app screenshots.](/assets/images/color-extract.png)](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"}{:class="portfolio-link"}

[Color Extract](https://github.com/ian-pvd/color-extract){:target="_blank"} is a simple React app that checks for colors in clipboard text. It finds color codes, de-dupes them, suggests color names, and creates a list of CSS variables to copy into your project. A time-saver when migrating old stylesheets or using new brand guidelines.

## More Repos
Check out the rest of [my github repositories](https://github.com/ian-pvd?tab=repositories){:target="_blank"} for more code samples.

A few of my WIP projects include the [Roundhouse](https://github.com/ian-pvd/roundhouse-2021){:target="blank"} WordPress theme scaffold for creators & multimedia libraries, and a [filmsâ€¢fm](https://github.com/ian-pvd/films-fm){:target="_blank"} movie tracking and rating app built with NextJS.

I've also made contributions to some open source projects, [node packages](https://github.com/bencevans/color-array-average), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/){:target="_blank"}, and previously on Alley's [Huron](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/huron){:target="_blank"} styleguide generator.

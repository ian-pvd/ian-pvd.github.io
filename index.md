I’m a Brooklyn-based web developer with 12 years experience working remotely for WordPress VIP partner agencies. You can check out my [portfolio](/portfolio/), view my [resume](/resume/), browse my [code](https://github.com/ian-pvd?tab=repositories&sort=){:target="_blank"}, read my [dev notes](/posts/), send me an [email](mailto:ianpvd+gh@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}, or chat with me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ian_pvd){:target="_blank"} or [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ian-pvd.bsky.social){:target="_blank"}.

I’m currently working as a freelance web developer, and building publishing tools for creators. I am available [for hire]({{ "/contact/#hire-me" | relative_url }}), and ready to join a new remote team as a front-end developer.
